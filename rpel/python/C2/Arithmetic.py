#C2 Arithmetic Opperations

a = 5          # = is the assignment opperator
b = 10

#basic opperations
print(a + b) #add
print(a - b) #subtract
print(a * b) #multiply
print(a / b) #divide

print("-------------------------")

#modulo opperator
print(b % a) #  =0        10 / 5 = 2      there is 0 remainder
print(7 % 5) #  =2         7 / 5 = 1      remainder 2

print("-------------------------")


#Relational operators
print (a == b)  #False  a does not equal b       == is a comparision

print(a<b)    #true   a is less than b
print(a>b)    #false  a is not more than b
print(a<=5)   #true   a is less than or equal to 5
print(b>=12)  #false  b is not more or equal to 12

print(a!=b)   #true   a is not equal to b

print("-------------------------")

#extra - exponent or power 
print(2**6)  #64    2 raised to the power of 6   2*2*2*2*2*2=64
